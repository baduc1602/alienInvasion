# alienInvasion
<p>This is simple game, easy to play and understand.
The player controls a ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and destroys the aliens. If the player shoots all the aliens they win. </p>
